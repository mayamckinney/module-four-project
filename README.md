# Horror Movie Quiz

## How to play

Simply click start! For every question you get wrong, the timer will take away 10 seconds. Currently, this is a work in progress. 

## What needs to be fixed

I'm still struggling to have the selected answer match with the correct answer.
I am also still working on having the timer end when all questions have been answered.
I am also still working on having the ability to be able to add your initials to the results screen.
